                This is a placeholder for DUEMODA's mission statement(?), or a description
                of the above image. Just filling space.

                Things that needs to change include: font, text styling, official layout. We might want to put an image next to this one?

                <h1>OUR MISSION</h3>
                <p>DUEMODA was created for the purpose of uplifting international fashion work at the University of Michigan.</p>
                <p>At the University of Michigan, we aim to represent all types of fashion both domestic and international. Because of that, our main goal is to create a magazine that showcases international fashion from Chinese Y2K to Mexican modernism to Italian Minimalism.</p>
                <p>Because of this, we will be having an article section where individuals across campus can comment on international fashion trends in relation to social commentary such as homophobia, misogyny, or racism as some examples. Why be basic when you can be Revolutionary, Exceptional and Daring?</p>
